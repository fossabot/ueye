# in its own runner environment.

  # The name "workflow-initializer" is used to identify

  workflow-initializer:

    # The 'runs-on' parameter designates the virtual machine (VM)
    # type for the job execution. On the other hand, 'ubuntu-latest'
    # indicates that the job will be executed on the most recent
    # version of an Ubuntu VM.

    # 'steps' refer to a series of actions or commands that need to
    # be carried out in this task. Each step has the ability to execute
    # a command, utilize an action, or complete various other tasks.

    steps:

      # Every step should include a 'name' and a 'run' key. The 'name'
      # serves as a clear, human-readable explanation of the step's function.
      # The 'run' key holds the command that will be executed during this step,
      # which in this case involves printing a message to the console.

      - name: Perform an action to end the workflow cleanly.

        # The 'run' command is used to execute a shell command. In this case,
        # the command is 'echo "... ðŸš€ initialize workflows", which will display
        # the message in the workflow log.

        run: echo "... ðŸš€ initialize workflows"
