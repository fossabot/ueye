## Code Coverage

#### Overall Coverage

*This graph shows the overall coverage of the code base, providing a visual representation of which parts of the code are well tested and which need more testing.*

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fhawk-user%2Fueye.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fhawk-user%2Fueye?ref=badge_shield)

#### File Coverage

*This graph breaks down the coverage by file, allowing to identify the files with the most and least coverage.*
